My name is Hayden Elza and I am a Forester and GIS Specialist. 

My interests are in how GIS, or technology in general, can be used in the field of forestry.

In my free time I enjoy tinkering and hacking. My habit is to learn by doing. For me learning in context is important skill for developing a long lasting, useful knowledge base.

In the summer time I put away my computers and venture outdoors. I currently live between two big lakes, the larger of which provides me with endless hours of sailing. When I can get out of the city, I enjoy hunting, fishing, hiking, backpacking, canoeing, kayaking, and biking.
