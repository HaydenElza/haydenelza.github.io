Hello World.

My name is Hayden Elza and I am a Forester and GIS Specialist.

My interests are in how GIS or technology in general can be 
used in the field of forestry. Not just in research, but in every day 
tasks such as routine forest inventories and optimizing workflow to 
produce better quality management plans that benefit both the forest and 
people whom depend on it.
