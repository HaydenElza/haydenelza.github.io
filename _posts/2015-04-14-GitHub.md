I was recently working on a script on a library computer and pushed my local changes at the end of my session. Unfortunately, it wasn't until later that night that I realized I had made commits under another GitHub user's name. This is not a huge problem, but it bothered me to have someone else's name listed in the commit history, so I went about fixing it.

GitHub has a help page on fixing this type of issue ([https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/](https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/)), but I did not know the mystery user's email so I modified the script as follows:

~~~
#!/bin/sh
git filter-branch --env-filter '
OLD_NAME="old_username"
CORRECT_NAME="my_username"
CORRECT_EMAIL="my_email@example.com"
if [ "$GIT_COMMITTER_NAME" = "$OLD_NAME" ]
then
    export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$CORRECT_NAME"
    export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$CORRECT_EMAIL"
fi
if [ "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME" = "$OLD_NAME" ]
then
    export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="$CORRECT_NAME"
    export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="$CORRECT_EMAIL"
fi
' --tag-name-filter cat -- --branches --tags
~~~

This takes advantage of the ```$GIT_COMMITTER_NAME``` variable to find the incorrect user name and replace it with my information.

This should be enough to fix the issue, but if you're like me you may have tried a few other things before finding the correct solution use ```git push -f origin HEAD^:master``` to clear the latest commit.
